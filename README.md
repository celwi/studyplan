# Studyplan
### A MEVN-based Tool for HTW IMI students to plan their studies and choose optional modules.


Developed as [HTW IMI-Project](https://imi-bachelor.htw-berlin.de/showtime/) (WiSe21/22).

Based on [studplan](https://github.com/JuliaZamaitat/studyplan) by [Julia Zamaitat](https://github.com/JuliaZamaitat).

## Set up development environment

### 1. Install docker and docker-compose
Further information on [docker.com/get-docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker.com/compose/install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### 2. Clone the repo
Clone this repository to your local machine.

### 3. Build docker container
Run the following command inside the project-directory.

```bash
sudo docker-compose build
```
### 4. Start docker container
Run the following command inside the project-directory.
```bash
sudo docker-compose up
```

### 5. Seeding the Database
To set up a test user run (in a second terminal window):
```bash
sudo docker exec node-server node seeds/usersWithStudyplanAndSemester.js
```
## Use the development environment

### Start Docker-Desktop
* If you have docker-desktop installed: Start this first.

* If you have only docker-engine installed: Do nothing.

### Start the environment
```bash
sudo docker-compose up
```
* add ```-d``` flag to run in background
* open App on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (changes will be applied automatically)

### Stop the environment
```bash
sudo docker-compose down
```
### See logs
```bash
sudo docker-compose logs
```

### Lint and format code

#### run this command either in ```client/``` or in ```root``` to lint and format the vue-app / node-server code: 
```bash
npm run lint
```

#### Or to lint and format both run:
```bash
npm run lint-all
```

### Run Server Tests (run in ```root```)
```bash
npm run test
```

### Clean reset the enviroment
#### If you have, for example, problems with not installed node packages run this command to completely rebuild the docker images:
```bash
npm run clean-docker-packages
```

#### If you want to completely reinstall the node packages on your local machine run this command either in ```client/``` or in ```root``` to clean the vue-app-packages / node-server-packages:
```bash
npm run clean-packages
```

#### Or to clean both run:
```bash
npm run clean-packages-all
```

## Deploy to HTW-Server

### Prerequisite

* Be inside the HTW network (or VPN)

* Configured SSH connection to the server.

### Deploy

To deploy vue-app and node-server to the production-server, do the following:

1. Clean your git working tree and commit any changes (check with git status) (main-branch will be deployed)

2. run ```./deploy prepare``` (use ```--no-cache``` to rebuild the node modules)

3. check the ```tmp-vue``` and ```tmp-node``` (thats the files, that will be deployed) (in ```.filesToDeploy``` is difined, which backend files will be deployed)

4. run ```./deploy deploy```

## Additional information
* You may want not always prefix the docker commands with ```sudo```, so look [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).
* In ```docker-dev-db``` the local database is stored. To reset remove the directory.
