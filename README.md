## Set up development environment

WARNING: It is highly recommended to use a linux machine. Otherwise a lot of scripts may not run correctly. Also it is recommended to use docker-cli instead of docker-desktop.

### 1. Install docker and docker-compose
Further information on [docker.com/get-docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker.com/compose/install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### 2. Clone the repo
Clone this repository to your local machine.

### 3. Build docker container and seed the Database
Run the following command inside the project-root-directory.

```bash
sudo npm run init
```
## Use the development environment

### Start Docker-Desktop
* If you have docker-desktop installed: Start this first.

* If you have only docker-engine installed: Do nothing.

### Start the environment
```bash
sudo npm run start
```
* Open App on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (changes will be applied automatically)
* You can login with test/test or admin/admin

### Stop the environment
```bash
sudo npm run stop
```
### See logs
```bash
sudo npm run logs
```

You can also specifie which logs you want to see. To do so just add ( vue-app / node-server / mongo-db )

For example:
```bash
sudo npm run logs vue-app
```

### Seed the Database
- You can seed everything with: (this will override all data in the  local DB)

    ```bash
    sudo npm run init-seed
    ```
    You can also use ```init-seed-no-warning ```

- You can also seed single files with:
    ```bash
    sudo npm run seed <List of files>
    ```
    - For example run ``` sudo npm run seed modalCourses testAndAdmin``` to seed the DB with all ModalCourses, test- and admin-user
    - The seeding-scripts are defined in ```seed```
    - You can pass ```-- --no-warning``` as first argument to ignore the warnings. 
        
        For example: ```sudo npm run seed -- --no-warning semester```

### run this command either to lint and format the vue-app / node-server code: 
```bash
npm run lint-all
```

### Run Server Tests (run in ```root```)
```bash
npm run test
```
### Clean reset the enviroment
#### If you have, for example, problems with not installed node packages run this command to completely rebuild the docker images:
```bash
npm run clean-docker-packages
```

#### If you want to completely reinstall the node packages on your local machine run this command to clean the vue-app-packages / node-server-packages:
```bash
npm run clean-packages-all
```
